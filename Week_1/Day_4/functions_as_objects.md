# Functions as Objects

* Functions are first-class objects
1) Functions can be stored in variables and passed around
2) Functions can do everything other objects can do (like having properties assigned to them)

* Callback function:
  * Function passed by reference into another function ("receiver" function)
  * Receiver function is accepting behaviour to perform by calling callback function it has access to
  * Receiver function can decide to call callback function at any time as many times as it wants
